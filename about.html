        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
          Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You
          can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.

        <h3 class="animated fadeInRight">I love to code because it is a team effort</h3>
        <p class="animated fadeInLeft">
          Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the
          account managers, and including the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product
          managers and project managers. Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to
          every single user that touches it (for good or bad).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="animated fadeInLeft">Coding is fun</h3>
        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
          I love the sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated problem! It just feels as if you
          have been at the best party in town.
